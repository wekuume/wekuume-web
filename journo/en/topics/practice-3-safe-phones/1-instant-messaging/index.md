## (3) Configuring Signal
 - Importing Messages
 - Making Signal the Default Message App
 - Encrypted Storage

### Importing Messages

As Signal can securely store your SMS messages, so it is recommended that you import the messages from your current SMS app.

Step 1: After registration is complete, Signal will open and you will be asked if you want to import your messages from the default SMS app on your phone. Press ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png)

![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/013.png)
Figure 7: Import messages into Signal

Once the import is complete you can access all your old messages in Signal and you should delete them from your other application.

### Making Signal the Default Message App

After your old messages have been imported you should make Signal the default SMS application so that all messages you receive appear in it and not the old application. This can be done by tapping ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png) when prompted.

![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/014.png)
Figure 8: Set Signal as the default SMS application

### Encrypted Storage

Signal also allows you to store all your messages in an encrypted container protected by a passphrase, so if someone gains access to your phone, they will not be able to access your messages when Signal is locked. After a set period of time, if you have not looked at any messages, Signal will automatically lock and you will have to enter your passphrase the next time you want to read your messages.

Step 1: Tap on  in the top right of your screen to bring up the menu and select .

Step 2: Scroll down to the PASSPHRASE section and uncheck Disable Password.

Step 3: When prompted enter a passphrase that will be used to protect the messages stored on your phone and tap .

## How-to

Below are the steps that you will take to send and receive encrypted text using Signal:

- Sending and Receiving messages
- Messaging Individuals
- Messaging Groups
- Identity Verification
- Reading Fingerprints
- Scanning Fingerprints
- Export your messages


##  **[1] Sending and Receiving messages**

**Note:** To send encrypted messages to your contacts, they must also have Signal installed, otherwise the message will be sent as an insecure SMS.

Signal can send messages as SMS using your mobile phone company to relay the message. With this option, even if your recipient is using Signal and the SMS is encrypted, your mobile phone company will know that you are sending a (encrypted) message to this particular recipient. 

If your phone is connected to the Internet, either using a data connection offered by your mobile phone company or using local wifi, Signal will instead send the message over an encrypted connection with a WhisperSync server. In this instance, your mobile phone company will not know who you are sending your messages to.

## **[2] Messaging Individuals**

**Step 1:** Open Signal and tap at the top of your screen to bring up your contact list.

**Step 2:** Tap on the contact you wish to message.

Note: The contact list will display at the top all your contacts who also use Signal (under the Signal Users heading) and then your full contact list (including Signal users) in the All Contacts section.

Figure 1: Signal contact list

**Step 3:** Compose your message in the box and tap to send.

Note If you send a message to another Signal user and you are connected to the Internet, the default option is to send it via Internet. If you want to send an encrypted SMS (using your mobile phone company) or an insecure SMS instead of an encrypted message long press to bring up the alternative sending options.

## _Things You Should Know_

Your sent messages are given different background colours / indicators to help you identify how they were sent:

Blue with a icon: The message was sent encrypted via Internet.

Figure 4: Encrypted message send via mobile data

Green with a icon: The message was sent as an encrypted SMS.

![5s.png]({{site.baseurl}}/media/5s.png)
Figure 5: Encrypted SMS

Green: The message was sent as an insecure SMS.

![6s.png]({{site.baseurl}}/media/6s.png)
Figure 6: Insecure SMS

The messages you receive from your contact will always be grey. If they have a icon, they were received encrypted. If there is no icon **the message was received insecurely.**
