## Deal with being locked out of your account

# Password reset
If you cannot log into your account, use the password reset or recovery link.

# Changing your password
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
<br>
# Contact your provider
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Most providers have a "Support" page where you can find out how to do this.
