# Down website
## Hosting problem

# Not loading at all?
If your website is not loading at all, the company that hosts your website may be having problems.
<br>
# Look up status
Visit the website of your hosting company and look for a 'status' blog. Alternatively, you can search on Twitter.com for other users with the same host who are having the same problem.



## Learn

# 1. Who built website
Who built your website? Are they available to help?
<br>
# 2. Hosting provider
Who is your web hosting provider? This is the company that provides the server where your website lives.
<br>
# 3. Account details
Do you have your account log in details for this hosting provider?
<br>
# 4. Domain name
Where did you purchase your domain name? In some cases this is also your website host, but it could also be another company.
<br>
# 5. Recovering your site
Do you have the log in details for the domain name service? If not, finding these is your first step to recovering your site
<br>
# 6. Who else knows details?
Who else knows or may have access to these account details?



## Poor site performance

# Slow site?
Does your site load slowly or only sometimes? Your site may be overwhelmed by the number and speed of requests for pages it is receiving – this is a performance problem.
<br>
# Don't panic!
This could be ‘good’ if your site has become more popular and simply needs some improvements to respond to more readers. Check your site analytics for a long-term pattern in growth.



## None of these?

If you have determined that none of these are at fault, you may be suffering from a denial of service attack. Refer to the [DDoS lesson](topics/practice-1-emergencies/5-ddos/1-1-intro.md) to learn more. 



## Billing problem

# Outstanding balance
Make sure your billing information is up to date and that there is no outstanding balance on your hosting services or your domain name to ensure your website is not taken down for billing problems.



## Legal problem

# Copyright
If your website is taken down due to a legal issue, the resources provided by [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://ssd.eff.org/), while focused on US copyright laws, are a good place to learn more.



## Censorship problem

# Similar sites down?
Can you visit other sites with similar content to your site? Try visiting websites related to yours or covering similar issues.
<br>
# Circumvent it!
Also try using Tor or Psiphon to access your site. If this helps, you have a blocking problem – you are still online for other parts of the world, but are being censored in your own country.



## Software problem

# Error messages?
Are you seeing error messages? This could be a software problem.
<br>
# Any recent changes?
Think about any recent changes you or your team may have made and contact your webmaster.
<br>
# Sent your webmaster a screenshot
Sending your webmaster a screenshot, the link of the page you are having problems with and any error messages you see will help them figure out what might be causing the problem.
<br>
# Helpful questions
Here are some [helpful questions](topics/practice-1-emergencies/5-ddos/3-13-learn.md) to ask your webmaster.



## Network problem

# Unavailable website
To see whether your web host is working but your website is unavailable, visit https://www.isup.me/.
<br>
# Disturbed account
If your site is up but you cant see it, it might be a network problem. It could also be in indication that your account has been disabled.



## Account hijacking

# Defacement problems
Are you seeing a website that is not yours? Are you receiving a warning from your browser about malware on your own site? This could be a defacement problem.
<br>
# Fix the problem
See [website defacement](topics/practice-1-emergencies/5-ddos/3-14-learn) for next steps. You will need to work with your web hosting provider and review the [Account Hijacking](topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md) section.
