## Safer communication on a smart phone

# Your phone can reveal your identity
Be aware that your smart phone is generally tied to your identity. This happens through billing, account services or SIM card registration. Your phone can also reveal your location.
<br>
# Encryption does not hide your identity
Encrypted messaging tools do not protect you from sharing this, but they do help protect the content of your communication.
<br>
# Secure Android messaging apps:
ChatSecure by The Guardian Project integrates with desktop chat Clients like Jitsi and Pidgin (using Gchat or Jabber/XMPP) and adds end-to-end encryption and the ability to send encrypted files, photos and audio.
<br>
# Secure Android messaging apps:
With csipsimple you can also make secure calls (such as from Ostel).
<br>
# Secure Android messaging apps:
RedPhone (for voice) and TextSecure (for SMS) by WhisperSystems are good, but both you and the person you are communicating with must be on Android (with these tools installed) in order for these tools to work.
<br>
# Secure Android messaging apps:
Orbot by The Guardian Project and the Tor Project allows you to access the web, instant messaging and email without being monitored or blocked by their mobile internet service provider. For more information, refer to the [Orbot lesson](topics/tool-10-orbot/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md)
