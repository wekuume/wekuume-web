Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting the content of your communications.

# Choosing the appropriate form
Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation, your threat model and the activities in which you are involved.

# Communicating when surveilled
If you are actively surveilled, for instance, you need to focus on many more aspects regarding your safety and the safety of the people you communicate with.

# End-to-end encryption
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption (such a PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Textsecure on your phone) is better than using a tool with transport-layer encryption (such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter).

# Anonymisation
Anonymisation is another component of secure communications. Anonymisation tools hide the sender and recipient of a message and will protect the identity of the participants in a communication.
