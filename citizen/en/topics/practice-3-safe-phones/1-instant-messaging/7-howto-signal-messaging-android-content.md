## How-to

Below are the steps that you will take to send and receive encrypted text using Signal:

- Sending and Receiving messages
- Messaging Individuals
- Messaging Groups
- Identity Verification
- Reading Fingerprints
- Scanning Fingerprints
- Export your messages


##  **[1] Sending and Receiving messages**

**Note:** To send encrypted messages to your contacts, they must also have Signal installed, otherwise the message will be sent as an insecure SMS.

Signal can send messages as SMS using your mobile phone company to relay the message. With this option, even if your recipient is using Signal and the SMS is encrypted, your mobile phone company will know that you are sending a (encrypted) message to this particular recipient. 

If your phone is connected to the Internet, either using a data connection offered by your mobile phone company or using local wifi, Signal will instead send the message over an encrypted connection with a WhisperSync server. In this instance, your mobile phone company will not know who you are sending your messages to.

## **[2] Messaging Individuals**

**Step 1:** Open Signal and tap at the top of your screen to bring up your contact list.

**Step 2:** Tap on the contact you wish to message.

Note: The contact list will display at the top all your contacts who also use Signal (under the Signal Users heading) and then your full contact list (including Signal users) in the All Contacts section.

**Step 3:** Compose your message in the box and tap to send.

Note If you send a message to another Signal user and you are connected to the Internet, the default option is to send it via Internet. If you want to send an encrypted SMS (using your mobile phone company) or an insecure SMS instead of an encrypted message long press to bring up the alternative sending options.

## _Things You Should Know_

Your sent messages are given different background colours / indicators to help you identify how they were sent:

Blue with a icon: The message was sent encrypted via Internet.

A icon in your message indicates that it has been delivered. Note: the only appears by default when messages are sent via Internet; to see them when sending SMS you need to enable SMS delivery report in settings.

The messages you receive from your contact will always be grey. If they have a icon, they were received encrypted. If there is no icon **the message was received insecurely.**

## [5] Identity Verification

To confirm that the messages you are sending and receiving are with the right person, you should both verify your Signal identities with each other.

## [6] Reading Fingerprints
The Following steps will need to be performed by both parties.

**Step 1:** Open an existing conversation with your contact and tap at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Tap from the pull-down menu.

**Step 3:**You will be presented with a 66-character fingerprint of your Signal identity and that of your contacts. These should be read to each other, and verify that you both have the same fingerprints for each other, either in person or via a medium that allows you to confirm visually or audibly to whom you are talking.
