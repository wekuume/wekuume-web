## Information compartmentalisation

# Information security
Think about what kinds of information you share with your colleagues and what information to keep private.
<br>
# Work continuity
Sharing information with your colleagues about your sources and research means that they will be able to continue your important investigations should something unexpected arise.
<br>
# 'Need to know' basis
On the other hand, sharing information only on a 'need to know' basis means you might be better able to protect people and prevent [infiltration by adversaries](link to future lesson).
<br>
# Sharing security
Whether you share much or little information with your colleagues, it is important that all information shared is done so securely.
