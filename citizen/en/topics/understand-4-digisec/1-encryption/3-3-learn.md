## Security certificates

# Encryption with HTTPS
The Web browser on your computer can make encrypted connections to sites using HTTPS. When they do that, they examine certificates to check the public keys of domain names (like www.google.com, www.amazon.com, or ssd.eff.org).

# Verifying websites
Certificates are one way of trying to determine if you know the right public key for a person or website, so that you can communicate securely with them.
<br>
# Certificate errors
From time to time, you will see certificate-related error messages on the Web. Most commonly, this is because a hotel or cafe network is trying to break your secret communications with the website.
<br>
# Other certificate problems
It is also common to see an error because of a bureaucratic mistake in the system of certificates.
<br>
# Breaking your encrypted connections
Occasionally, however, it is because a hacker, thief, police agency, or spy agency is breaking the encrypted connection. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to tell the difference between these cases.

# Be careful with sensitive information
This means you should never click past a certificate warning if it relates to a site where you have an account, or are reading any sensitive information.
