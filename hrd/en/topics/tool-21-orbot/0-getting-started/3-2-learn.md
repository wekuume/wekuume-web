# Route your communication through Orbot
In order to browse or chat on the internet anonymously, you need to install an app (browser or chat) which can route your communication through a proxy in conjunction with Orbot.
<br>
Refer to the related guides Tactical Technology Collective has put together for using [Orweb](https://securityinabox.org/en/women-hrds/orweb/android) and [ChatSecure](https://securityinabox.org/en/women-hrds/chatsecure/android) with Orbot.
<br>
# Step 4: Create a new Orbot identity
If at any stage you want to appear to come from a new location, you can get a new identity from Orbot by swiping left or right on the green Orbot image.
<br>
# Recieve confirmation
The image will briefly spin and then display You've switched to a new Tor Identity.
