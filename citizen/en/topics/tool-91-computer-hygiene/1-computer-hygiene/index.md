## Protect your computer against malware

# Importance of protection
You will be better able to successfully use some of the more complex digital technologies and tactics if your computer is well protected from malware.
<br>
# What is malware?
Malware is the general name for any malicious and undesirable software that attacks your computer and prevents it from working correctly.

## Keep your software up to date

# Limit software weakness and vulnerabilities
Keeping your software up to date limits weaknesses in the software that can be exploited by malware.
<br>
# Update your operating system
Always keep your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc) updated by downloading the latest updates from the respective websites.
<br>
# Sign up for security update alerts
Application software (Word, Excel, LibreOffice), either bought or open source, should also be kept up to date. Set your software to send you alerts about security updates, if such an option is available, so that you can get them as soon as they are released.
<br>
# Automatic updating
Most software on Windows will either update automatically or alert you to available updates, and point you to where you can download them. Windows operating system is set to auto-update by default.
<br>
# Turn auto-updating on
If your settings are not set to auto-update (mobile-based GSM data providers often advise you to turn off automatic Windows updates to conserve your data bundles) you can turn this function on by going to your computer’s Start menu, selecting All Programs and clicking Windows Update.
<br>
# Inform you of updates
Alternatively, through the process above you can set Windows Update to inform you of available updates and let you decide whether to download them or not.
<br>
# Download when ready
This way, you can download and install all your updates when you are in a place with a good and affordable internet connection (e.g. your office)



## Use open source software

# Updating software is constantly
For most small organisations, keeping your paid-for software up to date can be a challenge. Sometimes you have to buy new licences, or whole new software suites, which can be a drain on your budget.
<br>
# Open source software is often free
Consider switching to free and open source software (FOSS) such as the office suite LibreOffice, and an open source operating system such as GNU/Linux-based Ubuntu.
<br>
# Secure open source alternatives
Also consider using Mozilla Thunderbird as your email client and Firefox as your internet browser. As well as being free, FOSS software is also relatively more secure, as there are millions of volunteers looking at the source code and any one of them can spot bugs and fix them much quicker than engineers of proprietary software can.
<br>
# Updated regularly
Independent developers are also constantly developing digital security tools to add to FOSS software.
<br>
# Recommended free and open source software

## Keep backups of information

# Protect your information
Take measures to ensure that you recover your most important information in the unfortunate event that you lose a computer either through theft, system collapse, or confiscation/destruction by your adversaries.
<br>
# Keep a backup
Your best bet is to keep a backup of your important information. When creating a backup:
<br>
# Identify important information
Identify your important information and organize it in one
place, such as a folder in your computer.
<br>
# Choose appropriate storage medium
- Select a backup storage medium that allows you to replace your backup document with its latest version.
# External hard drives
An external hard disk drive (HDD), which connects to your computer via USB, has become the storage medium of choice for many.
<br>
# Use several external hard drives
External HDDs can offer storage space of up to 6TB. It is, however, recommended that you store your backups on smaller HDDs, from 350MB to 1TB, which you can keep in separate locations.
<br>
# Keep it separate from your computer
Keep your backups in a separate location from your computer. This ensures that you do not lose both the files on your computer and your backup at the same time.
<br>
# Keep in several different locations
Keeping a couple of backups in different locations is good practice, as long as these too are secured.
<br>
# Remotely backup information
You can also store your backups on remote servers via the internet – on what is now known as the cloud. Ensure you choose a secure online storage service.
<br>
# Recommended remote backup services
Consider secure services like [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com) and [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/), which are both quite secure and reliable.
