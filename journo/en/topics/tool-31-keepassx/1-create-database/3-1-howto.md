# Step 3. (Optional)
If you want to see the master passphrase you have chosen and entered, you can click the {â€˜eye' button} to the right of the entry field. (Be aware of your current circumstances, however. An untrusted person nearby may see your exposed master passphrase!)

To re-hide your master password, click the {'eye' button} again.
<br>
#Step 4.
Click {OK} to proceed.
<br>
# Step 5.
Enter your chosen master passphrase a second time to make sure you got it right. Click {OK}.
<br>
# Step 6. (Optional)
