# Protecting your browsing
Your government and hackers around the world are increasingly interested in knowing exactly what youâ€™re up to when you browse the web. This may present a serious risk to journalists and human rights defenders looking to access information, protect their sources, and communicate securely.
<br>
# What is Tor?
The Tor Browser is a service that provides both privacy and anonymity online by masking who you are and where you are connecting. The service also protects you from the Tor network itself.
<br>
# Anonymous and private browsing
For people who might need occasional anonymity and privacy when accessing websites, Tor Browser provides a quick and easy way to use the Tor network.
<br>
# Circumventing censorship
Tor can also be useful as a secure means of circumventing electronic restrictions so that you may access or publish blogs and news reports.
<br>
# How Tor works
Tor protects your anonymity by routing communications through a distributed network of servers run by volunteers from all over the world.
<br>
# Protecting your identity
Using Tor hides the sites you visit from potential onlookers, and hides your location/identity from those sites.
<br>
# Encryption network communication
Tor also takes steps to encrypt the communication to and through its network, but this measure can not extend all the way to a website which is sending or receiving content over non-encrypted channels (i.e. not providing https access).
<br>
# Browsing securely
Nevertheless, the advantage of using Tor when accessing such sites is that Tor can secure your communication up to the step between the last of the Tor servers and the non-secure site. This confines the chance to intercept the content to that last step.
<br>
# Tor Browser Bundle
The Tor Browser Bundle consists of the Tor software and a modified version of the Firefox web browser, which is designed to provide extra protection while using it. The browser bundle also includes [NoScript](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/firefox/windows#801t) and [HTTPS-Everywhere](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/firefox/windows#804) add-ons.

# Slower surfing
**Note:** There is a trade-off between anonymity and speed. Because Tor facilitates anonymous browsing by bouncing your traffic through volunteers' computers and servers in various parts of the world, it will definitely be slower than using other web browsers on your computer.

# Definitions
- Bridge Relay: A Bridge Relay is a Tor server that is not publicly announced. If you choose to use a bridge, the server can provide you with access to the Tor network even if Tor is blocked in your country.

# Definitions
- Port: In this chapter, a port is an access point through which software communicates with services running on other networked computers. If a URL, such as www.google.com, gives you the 'street address' of a service, then the port tells you which 'door' to use once you reach the correct destination.
<br>
# Definitions
When browsing the Web, you typically use port 80 for unsecured sites (http://mail.google.com) and port 443 for secured ones (https://mail.google.com).
<br>
# Definitions
- Proxy: A proxy is a software intermediary that runs on your computer, on your local network, or somewhere else on the Internet, that helps to relay your communication toward its final destination.

# Definitions
- Route: A route is the communication path on the Internet between your computer and the destination server.
