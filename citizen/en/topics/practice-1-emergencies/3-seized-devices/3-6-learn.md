# 1. Time device was gone

How long was the device out of your sight? If you have lost contact with your device for a long time and you feel there is a chance that something has been installed on it, consider the following:
<br>
# Computer:
Reinstall the OS from scratch and recover all documents from the last backup and scan all your documents and files with antivirus software. For more guidance on this, see the the [malware section](topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-1-intro.md).
<br>
# Phones and tablets:
Depending on your level of risk and how your device was taken, you may not want to use it again. If possible, move all of the data off of your phone or tables and purchase a new one.
<br>
# Compromised device?
If you cannot change devices but suspect it might be compromised, do not use your phone or tablet for sensitive communication or opening sensitive files. Do not take it to sensitive meetings or have it with you when discussing sensitive topics.
