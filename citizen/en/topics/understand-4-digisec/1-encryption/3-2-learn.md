## Private and public keys

# Keys
One of the most important concepts to understand in encryption is a key.
<br>
# Private keys
Common types of encryption include a private key, which is kept secret on your computer and lets you read messages that are intended only for you.
<br>
# Key signatures
A private key also lets you place unforgeable digital signatures on messages you send to other people.
<br>
# Public keys
A public key is a file that you can give to others or publish that allows people to communicate with you in secret, and check signatures from you.
<br>
# Matching keys
Private and public keys come in matched pairs, like the halves of a rock that has been split into two perfectly matching pieces, but they are not the same.
