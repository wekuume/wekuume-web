## What to post to social networking sites

# Be careful with what information you give
Social networking sites ask you for a good deal of data about yourself to make it easier for other users to find and connect to you.

# Identity fraud is common
Perhaps the biggest vulnerability this creates for users of these sites is the possibility of identity fraud, which is increasingly common.

# Less is more
The more information about yourself you reveal online, the easier it becomes for the authorities to identify you and monitor your activities.

# Posts can impact your family
The online activities of diaspora activists from some countries have led to the targeting of their family members by the authorities in their homelands.

# Do you need to post
Before posting, think about whether it's necessary to post:
 - birth dates
 - contact phone numbers
 - addresses

# Do you need to post
