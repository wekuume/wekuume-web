## Send and Receive messages

# You and your contact need Signal installed
To send encrypted messages to your contacts, they must also have Signal installed, otherwise the message will be sent as an insecure SMS.

# Sending via SMS
Signal can send messages as SMS using your mobile phone company to relay the message. With this option, even if your recipient is using Signal and the SMS is encrypted, your mobile phone company will know that you are sending a (encrypted) message to this particular recipient.
<br>
# Sending via the Internet
If your phone is connected to the Internet, either using a data connection offered by your mobile phone company or using local wifi, Signal will instead send the message over an encrypted connection with a WhisperSync server.

# Protecting your privacy
In this instance, your mobile phone company will not know who you are sending your messages to.
