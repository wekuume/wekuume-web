## Signal basics

# Messaging app
Signal sends text messages (SMS), messages via the internet (MMS) and internet voice calls (VOIP).
<br>
# Encrypted content
Using Signal will prevent anyone from being able to read the content of your text messages, but will not hide that you are sending messages, nor will it hide that your recipient is receiving messages.
<br>
# Contacts visible
Signal will only hide who the messages are being sent to if they are sent via the internet, but not when being sent by SMS
<br>
# Think about the risks
In some countries, an encryption app such as Signal may attract attention, be illegal or subject to legal constraints.
<br>

Before starting to use Signal, you must download it. Review [the installation guide](topics/tool-2-signal/0-getting-started/4-1-howto-install.md) to learn how to do so.

## Configure Signal

# Importing Messages
Signal can securely store your SMS messages, so it is recommended that you import the messages from your current SMS app.
<br>
# Importing Messages
After registration is complete, Signal will open and you will be asked if you want to import your messages from the default SMS app on your phone. Press ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png)

# Access old messages
Once the import is complete you can access all your old messages in Signal and you should delete them from your other application.
<br>
# Making Signal the Default Message App
After your old messages have been imported you should make Signal the default SMS application so that all messages you receive appear in it and not the old application. This can be done by tapping ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png) when prompted.
