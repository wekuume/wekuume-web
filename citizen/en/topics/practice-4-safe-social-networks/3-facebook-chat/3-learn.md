## Facebook communication basics

# Encryption is safe
You can easily enhance the privacy and security of your Facebook communications by using encryption.

# Unencrypted communication is dangerous
When you communicate over Facebook without the use of encryption, the company and all other third parties it potentially shares your data with (including other advertising companies and law enforcement agencies) can have access to the content of your instant messages (IM) and voice calls (VoIP).

# Protect your network
Not only can insecure communication potentially expose your data to beach, but also that of your contacts.

# Use Jitsi
To enhance the privacy and security of your communications, you can install Jitsi: a client which supports the Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol for IM encryption and ZRTP for VoIP encryption.

# Protect the content of your conversations
OTR clients like Jitsi not only makes the content of your communications inaccessible to various third parties, such as governments and corporations, it also makes it inaccessible to Facebook.
