## Key fingerprints

# Verifying identity
"Key fingerprints," are strings of characters like "342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928" that allow you to uniquely and securely check that someone on the Internet is using the right private key.

# Checking fingerprints
If you check that someone's key fingerprint is correct, that gives you a higher degree of certainty that it's really them.

# Fingerprints aren't perfect verifier
But it's not perfect, because if the keys are copied or stolen someone else would be able to use the same fingerprint.
