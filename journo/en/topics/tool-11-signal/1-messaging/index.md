## Send and Receive messages

# You and your contact need Signal installed
To send encrypted messages to your contacts, they must also have Signal installed, otherwise the message will be sent as an insecure SMS.
<br>
# Sending via SMS
Signal can send messages as SMS using your mobile phone company to relay the message. With this option, even if your recipient is using Signal and the SMS is encrypted, your mobile phone company will know that you are sending a (encrypted) message to this particular recipient.
<br>
# Sending via the Internet
If your phone is connected to the Internet, either using a data connection offered by your mobile phone company or using local wifi, Signal will instead send the message over an encrypted connection with a WhisperSync server.
<br>
# Protecting your privacy
In this instance, your mobile phone company will not know who you are sending your messages to.



## Message Individuals

# Step 1: Open Signal
Open Signal and tap at the top of your screen to bring up your contact list.
<br>
# Step 2: Select contact
Tap on the contact you wish to message.
<br>
**Note:** The contact list will display at the top all your contacts who also use Signal (under the Signal Users heading) and then your full contact list (including Signal users) in the All Contacts section.

# Things You Should Know
Your sent messages are given different background colours / indicators to help you identify how they were sent:
<br>
# Encrypted via Internet
Blue with a icon: The message was sent encrypted via Internet.
<br>
![4s.png](4s.png)
> Encrypted message send via mobile data

<br>
# Encrypted SMS

<br>
![5s.png](5s.png)
> Encrypted SMS

<br>

<br>
![6s.png](6s.png)

<br>
# Delivery notification
A icon in your message indicates that it has been delivered.
<br>
**Note:** this only appears by default when messages are sent via Internet; to see them when sending SMS you need to enable SMS delivery report in settings.
<br>
**Note:** The messages you receive from your contact will always be grey. If they have a icon, they were received encrypted. If there is no icon **the message was received insecurely.**

<br>
# Step 4: Read fingerprint
Verify that you both have the same fingerprints for each other, either in person or via a medium that allows you to confirm visually or audibly to whom you are talking.



## Scan fingerprints

**Note:** To verify fingerprints by scanning you need to have Barcode Scanner installed on your phone. If it is not available on your phone at the time of scanning Signal will download and install the app for you.

# Step 4: Click on barcode
On both your phones tap on ![](046.png).
<br>
# Step 5: Prepare to scan
On your phone tap "Scan your key to compare" and your contact should tap "Get my key scanned". Your contact's phone will display a QR code and your phone will open Barcode Scanner.
<br>

<br>
# Step 8: Repeat to verify yours
Once you have verified your contact's Signal identity, they should repeat the above steps to verify yours.
<br>

<br>
# Step 2: Select
