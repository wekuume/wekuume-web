## Dealing with unfounded fears

# Unfounded fears are normal
Stress, tiredness, fear, and experiencing previous trauma might inspire unfounded fears. Although this feeling is not desirable, it is natural - we all have unfounded fears at certain times.

# Being aware of fears
You might feel the need for increased caution or be extremely suspicious of strangers, public figures, organisations, family, or friends. Being aware of this will help you find tools for checking your perception.

# Checking your perception
We can do this through further research or through speaking with people we trust. We can also take steps to check our perceptions by speaking as a group or with our trusted allies, colleagues and friends.

# Become informed
For example, fears of surveillance could be clarified by taking the time to learn or review the basics of how [internet](topics/understand-1-how-it-works/4-internet/1-intro.md) and [mobile communication](topics/understand-1-how-it-works/2-phones/1-intro.md) works.
# Reduce misinformation
Doing so can reduce our anxiety or unfounded fears which may arise from misinformation, myths and mysteries associated with digital technology and electronic surveillance.
