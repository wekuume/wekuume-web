## Conversations basics

# Messaging App
Conversations is an open source chat client that encrypts messages using a Jabber/XMPP client. It can also be used for group chats.
<br>
# Encrypted content
Using Conversations will prevent anyone from being able to read the content of your messages, but will not hide that you are sending messages, nor will it hide that your recipient is receiving messages.
<br>
# Think about the risks
In some countries, an encryption app such as Conversations may attract attention, be illegal or subject to legal constraints.
<br>
# Installation guide

## Configure Signal

# Importing Messages

Signal can securely store your SMS messages, so it is recommended that you import the messages from your current SMS app.
<br>
After registration is complete, Signal will open and you will be asked if you want to import your messages from the default SMS app on your phone. Press ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png)
<br>
![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/013.png)
> Import messages into Signal

<br>
Once the import is complete you can access all your old messages in Signal and you should delete them from your other application.
<br>

### Making Signal the Default Message App
After your old messages have been imported you should make Signal the default SMS application so that all messages you receive appear in it and not the old application. This can be done by tapping ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png) when prompted.
<br>

> Set Signal as the default SMS application

<br>
### Encrypted Storage
Signal also allows you to store all your messages in an encrypted container protected by a passphrase, so if someone gains access to your phone, they will not be able to access your messages when Signal is locked.
<br>
After a set period of time, if you have not looked at any messages, Signal will automatically lock and you will have to enter your passphrase the next time you want to read your messages.
<br>
To enable encrypted storage, take the following 5 steps:
<br>
1. Tap on  in the top right of your screen to bring up the menu and select .
<br>
2. Scroll down to the PASSPHRASE section and uncheck Disable Password.
<br>
3. When prompted enter a passphrase that will be used to protect the messages stored on your phone and tap .
