# Address communications infrastructure

Address the communications infrastructure in the reporting area and identify any contingency equipment you may need.
<br>
Are electricity, Internet access, and mobile and landline phone service available? Are they likely to remain so? This will help you make prepared choices in choosing communications backups.
<br>
Is a generator or a car battery with a DC adaptor needed to power oneâ€™s computer? Should a satellite phone be used?
<br>
Basic needs such as nourishment and medical care must be addressed as well. Are food and water readily available? Is a hospital, clinic, or physician available? Is a medical kit needed, and what should it include? This is helpful for knowing what kinds of items you should bring along with you.
