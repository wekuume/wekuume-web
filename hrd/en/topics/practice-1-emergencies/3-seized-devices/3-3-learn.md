## Content and documents

# What's missing?
Make an inventory of *what information* was on your seized device. Examples may include files, location data, credit card data and more. This will help you learn about what may have been exposed or stolen.

# Is your missing information encrypted?
If you had some of your information encrypted, think about where your encryption keys are and what content you encrypted. This will help you know more about who potentially could read the content of your files and documents.
<br>
# Did you use encrypted communication?
Did you use encryption tools for email or chat (such as PGP and OTR)? This will help you learn if the content of your communications are secure or not.

# Reviewing your passwords
Do your accounts have saved passwords or automatically log in when you turn your device on? Are your passwords saved in your web browser instead of a password manager like KeePassX? If you do, be sure to change you passwords immediately and refer to the [Passwords](topics/understand-4-digisec/2-passwords/1-intro.md) lesson.
