Now that you have drawn the map of stakeholders in protection, determined the field forces, assessed your risk, recognised your strategies already in place, and established your strategy, it should not be difficult to draft a security and emergency plan.
<br>
When making an emergency plan, you should specify the frequency and exact means by which you will check in with editors and family members.
<br>
Your plan may also include a simple code to discreetly signal an immediate threat.
<br>
Codes could also be devised to signal that the journalist wants to meet at a prearranged location, or to switch to another means of communication.
<br>
In the event you or a colleague of yours becomes out of touch, the plan should specify how long editors and family members should wait before taking action.
<br>
Your emergency plan should include a detailed list of individuals and groups for editors and loved ones to contact or call locally, regionally and internationally.
<br>
