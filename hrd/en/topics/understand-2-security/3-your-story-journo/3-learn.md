## Steps to secure information for your story

Sometimes your story is bigger than you. You have a responsibility to protect the people involved and the information you are accumulating.
<br>
Sharing files or communicating insecurely can put lives at risk. Be sure to take all appropriate steps to protect you, your information, and others involve in the story.
<br>
Keep your documents in a safe place and have backups of important documents. Refer to the [Computer Hygiene](topics/tool-7-computer-hygiene/1-computer-hygiene/3-4-learn.md) section to learn how to do so.
<br>
Remember to store your backups securely. Refer to the [Veracrypt](topics/tool-5-veracrypt/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) lesson to learn how to do so.
<br>
Communicate securely with people involved, such as sources, and editors. Refer to the [Secure Communications](topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-1-intro.md) and [Encryption](topics/understand-4-digisec/1-encryption/1-1-intro.md) lessons to learn how to do so.
<br>
If you research your stories online, you may be leaving a record of your activities on your PCs and on the Web which can potentially compromise your safety – and that of your  sources – when investigating stories that others are trying to suppress.
<br>
Refer to the [Tor Browser lesson](topics/tool-9-tor-browser/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) to learn how to conduct internet research safely.
<br>
Prepare a plan for how others can continue working on your story if something happens to you. Refer to the [Planning and Preparing](topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) section to learn how to do so.
