Once the import is complete you can access all your old messages in Signal and you should delete them from your other application.

### Making Signal the Default Message App

After your old messages have been imported you should make Signal the default SMS application so that all messages you receive appear in it and not the old application. This can be done by tapping ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png) when prompted.

### Encrypted Storage

Signal also allows you to store all your messages in an encrypted container protected by a passphrase, so if someone gains access to your phone, they will not be able to access your messages when Signal is locked.

Step 1: Tap on  in the top right of your screen to bring up the menu and select .

Step 2: Scroll down to the PASSPHRASE section and uncheck Disable Password.
