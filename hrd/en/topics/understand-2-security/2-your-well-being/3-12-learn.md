# Fear is natural
Our survival response as humans is hardwired into special structures within our brains designed to drive our reactions to danger. We can call these special structures the “survival brain,” and the start-up mechanism for the survival brain is fear.
<br>
# Activating our "fear button"
When our "fear buttons" are pressed, our bodies are preparing to enact our instinctual responses to danger. Your body will react in one of seven ways:
<br>
# 1. Freeze
This response involves a person becoming utterly still—although highly alert—and ready for action. The strategy is to escape notice until the danger has passed.
<br>
# 1. Freeze
A great example would be of a bank robbery in which a customer stands quietly in the corner, thereby managing to avoid the robbers’ unwanted attention.
<br>
# 2. Flight
This response is the strategy that puts as much distance as possible between us and danger. In the bank robbery example, we might imagine a customer who leaps over a desk and breaks down a door to get away.
<br>
# 2. Flight
You might experience this in your work when sources or colleagues stop listening to you, evading or changing the subject, talking to a neighbor, or crack inappropriate jokes.
<br>
# 3. Comply
This response involves completely submitting to the aggressor in the hopes that cooperation will result in the attack ending quickly and without injury.
<br>
# 3. Comply
In the bank robbery example, this could be an employee who assists the robbers in opening the safe, packing up the money, and escaping.
<br>
# 3. Comply
In your work, you may see this with people participating in something they find particularly uncomfortable. They do this in the mindset that if they just cooperate they will get through it quickly and will then be able to move on to less distressing work.
<br>
# 4. Tend and Befriend
This response aims to ensure survival by getting closer to other human beings. We protect and care for those who are injured and more vulnerable, and we try to build relationships with those who are stronger and can protect and care for us.
<br>
# 4. Tend and befriend
In extreme cases we might even try to befriend an aggressor—commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome.
<br>
# 4. Tend and befriend
In the bank robbery situation, an instance where a customer draws children together, comforts and quiets them so as to reduce the danger is perfect example of this response method.
<br>
# 4. Tend and befriend
In doing so, she gains the respect and gratitude of the parents in the room. Should violence ensue, it is more likely those parents will act to protect and care for her.
<br>
# 4. Tend and befriend
At the heart of this response is the fact that human beings are social creatures and we draw together in times of danger.
<br>
# 4. Tend and befriend
In your work, you may see this with colleagues becoming overly concerned for each other’s well-being—a sign that they themselves might be experiencing distress.
# 5. Posture
This response is an attempt to drive off the danger by pretending to have greater physical strength than one actually does.
<br>
# 5. Posture
Going back to the bank robbery, a manager may confront the robbers with the lie that a silent alarm has been activated and the police are on their way.
<br>
# 5. Posture
In your work, you may see this with colleagues becoming argumentative and obstructive in order to undermine the authority of the trainer.
<br>
# 6. Fight
This response is the strategy of destroying or driving off the threat by attacking.
<br>
# 6. Fight
In the bank robbery situation, this would involve one or more people physically attacking the robbers, with or without weapons.
<br>
# 6. Fight
In your work, you might see this by a colleague being blamed for or even insulting another colleague for distress they are experiencing.
<br>
# 7. Dissociation
The Dissociation Response is characterized by the slowing of heart rate and breathing, a drop in blood pressure, and the person feeling calm and disconnected from the frightening reality in which they find themselves.
<br>
# 7. Dissociation
In the situation of the bank robbery, we might imagine a customer starting to giggle inappropriately or merely drifting off into a dreamlike state.
<br>
# 7. Dissociation
You might see this in your work if someone experiencing great distress becomes emotionally disconnected or inappropriate. Uncontrollable laughter when nothing is funny or daydreaming may both be signs of dissociation.
<br>
# 7. Dissociation
Dissociation is a sign of serious traumatization.
