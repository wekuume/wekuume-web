## Encrypted channels

# Secret postcard
Sending encrypted communication is like placing the postcard inside a locked box, which only you and those you trust know the combination to and are able to open and read the message.

# Choosing the right channels
Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation and the activities in which you are involved.
<br>
# End-to-end encryption
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption is recommended. PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Signal on your phone encrypt messages "all the way" (between you and your recipient).
<br>
# HTTPS encryption
If an end-to-end encrypted tool is not available, use tools that encrypt message only between you and the provider. Such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter which all use HTTPS.
<br>
# Use the best available channel
This, in turn, is better than using unencrypted communications (such as your phone or text messages). Do the best that you can with the resources and skills available.
