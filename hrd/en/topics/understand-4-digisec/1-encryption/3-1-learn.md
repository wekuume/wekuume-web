## What is encryption

# Basics
Encryption is the mathematical science of codes, ciphers, and secret messages.
<br>
# Encryption is old
Throughout history, people have used encryption to send messages to each other that (hopefully) couldn't be read by anyone besides the intended recipient.

# Encryption with computers
Today, we have computers that are capable of performing encryption for us. Digital encryption technology has expanded beyond simple secret messages.
<br>
# Current encryption uses
Today, encryption can be used for more elaborate purposes, for example to verify the author of messages or to browse the Web anonymously with Tor.

# Understanding encryption
Under some circumstances, encryption can be fairly automatic and simple. But there are ways encryption can go wrong, and the more you understand it, the safer you will be against such situations.
