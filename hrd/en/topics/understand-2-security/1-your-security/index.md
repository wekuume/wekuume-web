> security - make it more about what are the components that would go into your security - maybe kind of a getting started. your security is physical safety (what people would think of), emphasise this,but also security of information….your sources, your well being is important (give a concrete example here - if you are depressed or shocked you won’t be able to continue your job. it’s part of your security think about your well being and those of moths.

> explain in your security and well being are more important than story - that this is true and will allow you to continue doing your work.

>in security module also put “it is impportant to take care of trauma or you won’t be able to do your work”

> 'be careful with each other, so that we can be dangerous together.”

Once we understand how individuals and teams react to stress and threats, it becomes important to reflect on how healthy practices towards this can be fostered in our groups and organisations.
Creating a safe and regular environment for communicating about security within teams and organisations is one of the most important preparatory steps towards a successful security strategy and organisational well-being.

side from this clear practical necessity, creating space to talk about security with our peers and colleagues helps us to:
• more accurately perceive the threats to our work (reduce unrecognised threats and unfounded fears)
• understand why members of the team might react differently to stress or threats (individual responses to threats)
• assign roles and responsibilities for security measures
• increase group ownership of security measures
• build solidarity and care for colleagues who are suffering from threats.

However, there may be barriers that prevent us from discussing security openly within our organisation. Some barriers may include:
• heavy workloads and lack of time
• simply being afraid to discuss it
• a sense that our observations on security might be perceived as fear, para-
noia or weakness
• not wanting to confront colleagues about their practices
• not wanting to be the first to bring the matter up for discussion
• gender issues and/or power dynamics.



Self-care should not be understood not a selfish act, but rather as a subversive and political act of self-preservation.

Our approach to security and protection must take into account the effects not
only  of  physical  violence,  but  also  structural,  economic,  gender-based  and  institutional  violence,  harassment  and  marginalisation.  This  may  be  perpetrated  by   the  State,  but  also  by  private  corporations,  non-State  armed  groups,  or  even  our own  communities  and  those  close  to  us.  It  can  deeply  affect  our  psychological well-being,  our  physical  health,  and  our  relationships  with  friends,  family  and colleagues.  Awareness  of,  and  action  regarding  these  threats  is  vital  in  order  for our activism and resistance to be sustainable, and in order to facilitate our ability to identify and implement strategies for our security and protection. As such, we understand and assert self-care, all too often considered ‘selfish’ among activists, to  be  a  subversive  and  political  act  of  self-preservation,  and  one  which  is  fundamental to effective security strategy and culture.

Our security strategies also have to be regularly updated. As the context around us changes, so do the tasks and challenges in integrating security into our work.

As  such,  comprehensive  security  must  not  only  include  our  bodies,  emotions and  mental  states,  but  also  the  electronic  information  contained  in  devices  in our  hands,  pockets,  bags,  homes,  offices,  streets  and  vehicles.  















Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To minimise potential risks, it is important to always prepare a security assessment.
<br>
> Step 1
# Identify known hazards

Identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
Consider the possibility that any circumstance — from a tense political situation to a natural disaster — can escalate in severity.
<br>
The assessment should include:
- where to stay and where to seek refuge if necessary
- where and how to get updated information inside the country
<br>
- whether equipment such as a weather-band or shortwave radio is needed
- whom to contact in the country, from local human rights groups to foreign embassies, for emergency information
<br>
 - travel plans and methods within the country
 - multiple entry and exit routes.

> Step 2
# Address communications infrastructure

Address the communications infrastructure in the reporting area and identify any contingency equipment you may need.
<br>
Are electricity, Internet access, and mobile and landline phone service available? Are they likely to remain so? This will help you make prepared choices in choosing communications backups.
<br>
Is a generator or a car battery with a DC adaptor needed to power one’s computer? Should a satellite phone be used?
<br>
Basic needs such as nourishment and medical care must be addressed as well. Are food and water readily available? Is a hospital, clinic, or physician available? Is a medical kit needed, and what should it include? This is helpful for knowing what kinds of items you should bring along with you.
<br>

## Learn

> Step 3
# Consult diverse sources

Consult diverse sources including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
<br>
Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
<br>
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers,[researching the risks](topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-intro.md), and arranging a contact network.
