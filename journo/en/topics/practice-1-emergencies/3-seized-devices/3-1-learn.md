## Assess the situation


# Appropriate response
How did you lose your device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority, or did you simply lose track of it? If this is an adversary you need to develop [an appropriate response](topics/practice-2-planning/1-threats/1-1-intro.md).
<br>
# Security protections
Were there any [strong security protections](topics/understand-4-digisec/0-getting-started/1-intro.md) in place, such as full disk encryption or password protections? This will help you to learn if files on your computer containing sensitive information are secure or not.
<br>
# Content and contacts
[What information  was on your device](topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-3-learn.md), and what might harm your [networks and  sources]((en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-3-learn.md) if it gets into the wrong hands? [Securely Communicate](topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications) with your networks to let them know.
<br>
# Device missing or returned
Is the device [still missing]((en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-5-learn.md)) or [has it been returned](topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-6-learn.md)? Be careful as you do not know who has had access to your device. Possibly treat it as if it is now untrusted or compromised.
