## Access to your phone

# Enable Lock SIM card
Enable Lock SIM card, found under *Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Set up SIM card lock*.
<br>
# Enable Lock SIM card
This will mean that you must enter a PIN number in order to unlock your SIM card each time your phone is switched on, with out the PIN no phone calls can be made.
<br>
# Set up a Screen lock
Set up a Screen Lock, found under *Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Screen Lock*, which will ensure that a code, pattern or password needs to be entered in order to unlock the screen once it has been locked.
<br>
# Set up a Screen Lock
We recommended using the PIN or Password option, as these are not restricted by length. Refer to the [Passwords](/en/topics/understand-4-digisec/2-passwords/1-1-intro.md) lesson to learn how to create a strong password.
<br.
# Set security lock timer
Set the security lock timer, which will automatically lock your phone after a specified time.
<br>
# Set security lock timer
You can specify a value which suits you, depending on how regularly you are willing to have to unlock your phone.



## Device encryption

# Turn on
If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should turn on device encryption. This can be done in *Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Encryption.*
<br>
# Set a screen lock password
Before you can utilise device encryption, however, you will be required to set a screen lock password.
<br>
**Note:** Before starting the encryption process, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.



## Network settings

# Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth by default.
Ensure that Tethering and Portable Hotspots, under Wireless and Network Settings, are switched off when not in use. *Settings -> Wireless & Networks -> More -> Tethering & Mobile hotspot*.
<br>
# Manually switch off Near Field Communication
If your device supports Near Field Communication (NFC), this will be switched on by default, and so must be switched off manually.



## Location settings

# Turn off Wireless and GPS location
Switch off Wireless and GPS location (under Location Services) and mobile data (this can be found under *Settings -> Personal -> Location*). Only turn on location settings if you need them.
<br>
# Importance of turning off
Turning off Wireless and GPS location reduces the risk of location tracking, saves battery power, and reduces unwanted data streams initiated by applications running in the background or remotely by your mobile carrier.



## Caller identity

If you want to hide your caller-ID, go to *Phone Dialler -> settings -> Additional Settings -> Caller ID -> hide number*.



## Software updates

# Update regularly
To ensure that you phone remains secure, it is strongly recommended to keep your software updated. There are two types of updates that need to be checked:
<br>
# Operating system
The phone operating system: go to: *settings -> About phone -> updates -> check for updates*.
<br>
# Apps you have installed
Apps you have installed: Open the Play store app, from the side menu select My Apps.
<br>
**Note:** When updating your phones software it is important to do it from a trusted location such as your internet connection at home instead of somewhere like an internet cafe or coffee shop.
