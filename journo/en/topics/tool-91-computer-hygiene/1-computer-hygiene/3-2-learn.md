## Keep your software up to date

# Limit software weakness and vulnerabilities
Keeping your software up to date limits weaknesses in the software that can be exploited by malware.
<br>
# Update your operating system
Always keep your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc) updated by downloading the latest updates from the respective websites.
<br>
# Sign up for security update alerts
Application software (Word, Excel, LibreOffice), either bought or open source, should also be kept up to date. Set your software to send you alerts about security updates, if such an option is available, so that you can get them as soon as they are released.
<br>
# Automatic updating
Most software on Windows will either update automatically or alert you to available updates, and point you to where you can download them. Windows operating system is set to auto-update by default.
<br>
# Turn auto-updating on
If your settings are not set to auto-update (mobile-based GSM data providers often advise you to turn off automatic Windows updates to conserve your data bundles) you can turn this function on by going to your computerâ€™s Start menu, selecting All Programs and clicking Windows Update.
<br>
# Inform you of updates
Alternatively, through the process above you can set Windows Update to inform you of available updates and let you decide whether to download them or not.
<br>
# Download when ready
This way, you can download and install all your updates when you are in a place with a good and affordable internet connection (e.g. your office)
