## Understand risk

Risk refers to possible events, however uncertain, that result in harm. Understanding risks can know the right measures to take in order to be more secure.

Perhaps without realising, we take decisions based on risk analyses every day. You may choose not to walk home through a particular neighbourhood you consider dangerous, or to lock your office doors when you leave in the evening, to deter thieves.

The idea of this lesson is to learn to understand risk as it applies to our activities as journalists and as private people.
